# ROM Manager
A simple manager for one or more rom folders, so you don't have to do the hassle of switching between emu's.

To install it, simply: download this as zip, unzip it somewhere then install node (im using v18) and execute these commands (in the unzipped environment)
```console
$ npm i
$ node .
```
Then, once you see it ask you for any rom folders, add one or quit, then edit the config and add all of the rom files you'll need in `fileTypes` and `identifiers`.
